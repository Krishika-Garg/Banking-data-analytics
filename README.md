# Banking Customer Data – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a banking customer dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that support **data-driven decision-making** and customer behavior analysis.

The analysis emphasizes understanding customer demographics, financial attributes, and relationships between variables through structured exploration and visualization.
